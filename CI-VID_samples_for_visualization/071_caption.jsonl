            "video_content": "A small green toy resembling Donatello, a character from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, is shown. The toy is predominantly light green with a purple mask covering its eyes and the top of its head. It has white, stylized eyes and a large smile exposing teeth. The figure features exaggerated cartoonish proportions, with a large rounded head and smaller body that includes sculpted limbs. The toy is holding a red staff, characteristic of Donatello's traditional weapon. A person's hand is interacting with the toy, pressing down on its head and deforming it slightly as if testing its flexibility. The hand is well-maintained with visible fingernails. The toyâ€™s material appears to be soft and squishy, likely rubber or a similar flexible material. During the interactions, the movements of the hand create bends and squeezes on the toy. The hand alternates between squeezing and releasing the toy, causing it to slightly return to its original shape. The interaction focuses entirely on showcasing the toy's squishiness and tactile features.",
