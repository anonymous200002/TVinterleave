A man dressed in parachute gear, including a harness, gloves, and a blue jacket, is seated at the open door of the aircraft. He appears to be preparing for a skydiving activity while two other individuals, also wearing parachute gear, stand near him. One is in a black hoodie with orange and blue pants, and the other is in a red and black checkered shirt with similar orange and blue pants. These individuals observe and possibly assist him in checking his equipment. In one section, the seated man adjusts his harness and equipment. The event appears to be taking place outdoors at a skydiving site, as seen by the surrounding elements such as a yellow airstrip marker flag, open green fields, and a clear sky with some scattered clouds.",

One person wearing a blue jumpsuit with skydiving gear, including a helmet and gloves labeled 'SEND IT,' is seated next to a person in a red flannel shirt who is tethered to the skydiving instructor using a harness. This appears to be a pre-skydiving preparation, as safety checks and communication are taking place. The instructor is ensuring that all harness points are secured, holding onto the harness strap on the chest of the other individual. Another person is seated towards the front, wearing headphones, likely the pilot, operating the controls and gauges visible in the cockpit area. A GPS or monitoring device is also seen mounted near the front dashboard. The mood is focused on preparation and ensuring all safety measures are in place before the skydive.",
