In one hand, she holds a small round, red plastic container with a screw cap removed, while in the other, she holds a yellow hot glue gun with a metallic nozzle. The video progresses to demonstrate the process of applying hot glue, with the nozzle of the glue gun aimed toward the container. Throughout the video, there is text in another language, written in bold white characters, appearing near the top and bottom portions of the scene.",

Initially, four open jars with visible paint—red, yellow, white, and black—are shown. Gradually, additional open paint jars of green, blue, and purple are added to the arrangement, forming a circular or semi-circular pattern. Some jars have their lids placed on top or next to them, while others remain open, revealing the paint inside. Around the paint jars, a clear glass of water is positioned to the right and partially below them, while two paintbrushes lie horizontally near the top left corner—one with a red handle and the other with a purple handle. The surface itself appears to have faint traces of colorful smudges or paint marks in green, blue, and possibly pink. In the lower part, a faint blue paint stroke is visible on what seems to be a piece of white paper. Below the jars, Cyrillic text reading 'БЕРИ И ДЕЛАЙ' is displayed.",

In the surrounding space, elements such as paintbrushes and the glass of water add context to an artistic or creative activity environment. The lighting is bright and uniform, eliminating shadows and ensuring all objects are well-illuminated.\"\n}\n```"
