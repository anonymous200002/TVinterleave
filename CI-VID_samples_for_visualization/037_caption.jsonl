Beside her is a small mouse with soft, grey fur. The mouse appears to be animated and expressive, raising its front paws and with its mouth open, giving the impression of surprise or excitement. The carriage interior is upholstered with dark, patterned fabric featuring floral designs. This seems to be a scene from a fantastical or fairy-tale storyline.",

The texture of the jacket displays intricate floral patterns, and the coat is structured with prominent seams. A small rodent, likely a mouse, with light brown fur and a long tail, is seen mid-air in motion, as if jumping or falling, in close proximity to the person. The mouse’s limbs are extended outward, and its body rotates slightly during the movement. The actions suggest a brief dynamic interaction between the two subjects, with the mouse's trajectory being the main movement catching attention. The person’s posture remains upright, and there’s no visible interaction between the person and the mouse during this brief period.",
