The sandwich consists of a crusty, lightly browned baguette encasing a variety of fillings. Between the bread roll, there is a layer of green lettuce providing a fresh, crisp appearance. Juicy red tomato slices add a splash of color and freshness. A slice of yellow cheese and a sunny-side-up egg with seasoning specks add a hearty touch. There is a patty, likely a beef or similar type, contributing a substantial look to the sandwich. A lobster claw-shaped object with a red upper and yellow under part appears near the sandwich in the first frame and returns again as if interacting or about to grab the sandwich, hinting towards a potential action or the presence of a character immediately off-frame.",

It has a dark blue body with bright yellow circular markings on its cheeks and a yellow triangular pattern above its eyes, indicating its alertness even though its eyes are closed. The beak is large, orange, and holding a sandwich-style meal consisting of a round brown bun filled with leafy greens, possibly lettuce, and pale yellow noodles visible inside the bun. The character is shown from a frontal angle, focusing on its face and meal, indicating that this animated character, possibly a Pokémon named Toxel, is enjoying its food. The video may fall under the category of an animation or a cartoon, possibly a scene from a Pokémon series or movie.",
