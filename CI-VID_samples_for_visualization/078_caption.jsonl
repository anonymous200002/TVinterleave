The hand is palm-down, fingers slightly spread, allowing for a comparison of the spiderâ€™s size relative to the hand. The spider seems alert and is actively maneuvering its legs. The details of the hand, including skin texture and fingernails, are visible, adding a scale to the encounter. The interaction seems cautious and measured, indicating a focus on observing the spider closely without causing harm.",

A person wearing a blue shirt, a bandana around their neck, and brown pants is kneeling close to the tarantula. This person is handling a transparent plastic container and is preparing to use it, perhaps to capture or observe the tarantula. They are also holding a pair of tweezers. Their attention is fully focused on the tarantula. To the right, a grey backpack with a carabiner attached is placed on the ground. The tarantula, identifiable by its compact body and eight legs, is situated near small divots in the rock, possibly holes or natural indentations. The setting is outdoors, possibly in a forest or woodland, evidenced by leaves and tree branches surrounding the area. Lighting indicates it might be early evening or dusk as there are subtle shadows and dark areas in the surroundings.",

            "video_background": "The background shows fallen leaves and branches, suggesting a natural, perhaps wooded, environment. The lighting is moderate, with shadows indicating low light conditions, typical of early evening time. A grey backpack rests on the ground behind, enhancing the outdoor, expedition-like atmosphere."
