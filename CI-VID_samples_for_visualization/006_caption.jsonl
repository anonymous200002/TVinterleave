            "video_content": "A man is seen at a gas station, interacting with multiple fuel cans. There are at least four fuel cans visible, two yellow and two red, each with black caps. The man wears a black cap and a black t-shirt, and appears to be in the midst of handling or preparing to fill these cans. He is standing next to a blue vehicle, which is parked close to the fuel station. The setup suggests a scene focused on refueling or fuel management, possibly for personal or commercial use. Nearby, there is a gasoline pump with hoses that seems to be in use for transferring fuel into the cans. The sequence suggests preparation and organization of the items involved in this act. The action takes place in broad daylight under direct sunlight, as evidenced by shadows on the ground, and no other people are present in the immediate vicinity. The man's interaction with the cans denotes a specific activity of possibly securing or verifying the containers are ready for transport or use.",

The person's attire includes a black t-shirt with visible branding on the sleeve. The gas pump features the Shell logo, indicating the type of station, and there are various fuel nozzles visible, each possibly designated for different fuel types as identified by their colors. The person is actively handling the pump with one hand on the nozzle and the other reaching towards the area possibly where the pump controls or lever are located. The event unfolds swiftly, suggesting the routine nature of vehicle refueling.",

Several plastic fuel canisters, predominantly in red and yellow colors, are lined up on the ground near a fuel pump. The person holds a yellow fuel nozzle, directing it into the open mouth of one of the red canisters. They are dressed in dark pants and sneakers with a colorful pattern. The nozzle is connected to a flexible hose attached to the pump, a piece of equipment prominently marked with the Shell emblem, indicating the brand of the fuel station. The person appears focused as they manage the flow of fuel into the canisters. The canisters have metallic lids placed nearby, implying they have been recently opened for refueling.",
