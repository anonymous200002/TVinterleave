The April page has simple blue line drawings, including a car, a pair of scissors, and what resembles a series of squares potentially representing days. As the calendar changes to May, the drawings visible include a cleaning brush and bucket, a cake with three candles, and other simplistic, illustrative sketches, possibly indicating events or reminders.

He exhibits a range of expressions, from his classic bemused look to a more thoughtful demeanor. Beside him, a wall calendar prominently displays the month of May with a simple grid layout. As the sequence progresses, Mr. Bean transitions from a casual and relaxed state to a more contemplative posture. His eyes, which are characteristically expressive, shift directions as if considering something important. Throughout, the teddy bear remains nestled in his arm, underscoring its significance as his cherished companion.
