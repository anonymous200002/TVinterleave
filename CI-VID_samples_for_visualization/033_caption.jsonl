            "video_content": "The video shows the rear cargo area of a sports car, specifically a Nissan 350Z, identifiable by the logo featuring the letter 'Z' on the metal panel inside the trunk. The trunk contains a Nitrous Express (NX) nitrous oxide bottle, which is white with a prominent NX logo in red and blue, along with various labels and safety warnings. Connected to visible brackets, the nitrous bottle appears securely mounted within the trunk space. Metallic orange structural bracing, likely a roll cage or reinforcement bar, is visible towards the upper rear area of the trunk, adding a racing or performance modification to the car’s setup. Later, there is an individual wearing a black T-shirt with a design reading 'SR20 Problems' and depicting an engine block. The scene transitions back to focusing on the nitrous oxide bottle in the trunk, with a hand in gloves coming into view briefly, possibly interacting with the equipment.",
            "camera_angle": "The camera alternates between a close-up of the car’s trunk interior highlighting the nitrous bottle and a close-frontal view of the person in the black T-shirt.",
            "camera_movement": "The camera exhibits slight panning and repositioning to highlight the nitrous bottle and later switches to a static shot of the person. Movements are otherwise minimal.",

The external setting where the person is shown includes a parking lot with parked cars, trees, and buildings, with sunlight visible in the distance.\"\n}\n```"

The bottle has a polished metal bracket securing it in place. The text on the bottle includes large red and blue 'NX' letters and additional smaller content, such as the words 'Nitrous Express,' '3156,' and various safety markings like a green gas pictogram. Another individual, wearing a black glove, is holding one side of the bottle's compartment. The bottle is securely fitted into a recessed black compartment with a rectangular opening next to it. The first person places their hand on the bottle, adjusting its position slightly.",

            "video_background": "The background is composed of a dark, textured black material surrounding the bottle’s compartment. Nearby metal bolts and parts of a mechanical surface are visible, suggesting an automotive setting. The lighting is even, reducing shadows and highlighting the reflective surface of the bottle and metal components.\"\n}\n```"
