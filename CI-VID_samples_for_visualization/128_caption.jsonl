The trunk is intricately carved with various elements, including prominent skull features and skeletal hands, giving it an eerie appearance. These carvings are embedded into the bark-like surface, which is rich in texture and weathered details that suggest a longstanding presence. The ground surrounding the sculpture is predominantly grassy, and the sculpture stands in a relatively open space with sparse trees and distant structures, adding context to its surroundings. There is a large sign in the distance advertising free breakfast and privilege points. The overall focus is on the artistic and possibly macabre design and craftsmanship of the sculpture, emphasizing its complex and unique aesthetic elements.",

The sculpture is embedded within a large piece of gnarled, aged wood, displaying a variety of natural grooves and patterns that accentuate its rugged surface. As the seconds pass, the view does not significantly shift but remains focused on the frontal aspect of the skull, maintaining the carved features prominently in view. The earthy tones of the wood contrast with the green grass that surrounds its base, indicating the sculpture's outdoor location.",
